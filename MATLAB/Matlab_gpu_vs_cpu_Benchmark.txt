Summary
i. 2 tasks benefit significantly (> 50X easily) from GPU: Random numbers generation and Matrix Multiplication (as expected). 
ii. Other tasks have a 1X ~ 3X improvement. See below for details. 


Remarks
i. Proper benchmarking should be done with multiple iterations; the small numbers are not that reliable with 1 iteration. 
ii. Unless specified otherwise, everything is run with 10000 x 10000 matrices and/or 10000 x 1 vectors.
iii. ‚ÄùMatrix square root" ran into memory issues with GPU when the matrix is too large.
